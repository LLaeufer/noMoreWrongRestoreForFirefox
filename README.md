# noMoreWrongRestoreForFirefox
Prevents Firefox from restoring after an OS restart, if automatic restoring is disabled

Use "installNoMoreWrongRestoreForFirefox.sh" to install on most distros, the uninstall file works similar.
The "installSilverblue.sh" and "makeRPM.sh# are a very early test for Fedora Silverblue.
